              <h2>About Zine Builder</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
              Zine Builder was made to help visualize what a zine would look
              like printed duplex, double sided, 2 pages per sheet and flipped
              short-side. In past personal projects I found it hard to visualize
              the final product for proof reading. Hopeufully this can help
              people with their own projects.
              <br /><br />
              Maybe one day I'll add more features to this site, like the
              ability to save work in progress or something, but since this is
              hosted on github that's probably unlikely anytime soon.
              <br /><br />
              If you'd like to see what else I'm working on, here is a link to
              my zine, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hillresidencezine/">Hill Residence</a>. It's a fanzine about the animated show
              King of the Hill.
